# Simple-Renderdistance-v1
The Sourcecode of my Addon (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1918401107) on Steam.

# Description
This is the sourcecode a Addon I made (link above).
The use of this Addon is to have a sizeable renderdistance. 
For example, if you don't want to see all the props across the map, you can use this addon to make them invisible for your client.
